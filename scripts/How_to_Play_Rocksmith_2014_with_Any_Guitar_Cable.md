# How to Play Rocksmith 2014 with Any Guitar Cable
 
Rocksmith 2014 is a popular game that helps you learn guitar by playing along with songs. However, the game requires an official Real Tone Cable, which can be expensive or hard to find. Fortunately, there is a way to play Rocksmith 2014 with any guitar cable, using a software called NoCableLauncher.

NoCableLauncher is a program that allows you to use any audio interface as a guitar input for Rocksmith 2014. It works by emulating the Real Tone Cable and bypassing the game's check for it. You can also use it to play multiplayer with two different input devices.
 
In this article, we will show you how to set up NoCableLauncher and play Rocksmith 2014 with any guitar cable. You will need:
 
- A guitar cable (either 1/4 inch or 3.5 mm)
- An adapter (mono or stereo) depending on your cable
- A computer with Windows and Steam
- A copy of Rocksmith 2014
- The NoCableLauncher software (download it from [here](https://github.com/Maxx53/NoCableLauncher))

## Step 1: Connect Your Guitar Cable to Your Computer
 
First, you need to connect your guitar cable to your computer. You have two options: the line-in port or the microphone port. We recommend using the line-in port, as it has better sound quality and less background noise.
 
To connect your guitar cable to the line-in port, you will need a 1/4 inch to 3.5 mm adapter (mono or stereo). Plug one end of your guitar cable into your guitar, and the other end into the adapter. Then, plug the adapter into the line-in port of your computer.
 
To connect your guitar cable to the microphone port, you will need a 3.5 mm cable (mono or stereo). Plug one end of your guitar cable into your guitar, and the other end into a 1/4 inch to 3.5 mm adapter (mono or stereo). Then, plug the adapter into one end of the 3.5 mm cable, and the other end into the microphone port of your computer.
 
## Step 2: Configure Your Audio Settings
 
Next, you need to configure your audio settings on your computer. Right-click on the sound icon on your taskbar and select "Recording devices". Disable all of your recording devices except for the one that corresponds to your guitar input. Right-click on it and select "Properties". Go to the "Advanced" tab and change the default format to "2 channel, 16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality)". Click "OK" to save the changes.
 
Do the same for your output device (speakers, headphones, etc.). Right-click on the sound icon on your taskbar and select "Playback devices". Right-click on your output device and select "Properties". Go to the "Advanced" tab and change the default format to "2 channel, 16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality)". Click "OK" to save the changes.
 
## Step 3: Edit Your Rocksmith.ini File
 
Now, you need to edit your Rocksmith.ini file in your game folder. This file controls the audio settings of Rocksmith 2014. You can find it in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Rocksmith2014 by default.
 
Open the Rocksmith.ini file with a text editor (such as Notepad) and make sure it has the following values:
  ``` [Audio] EnableMicrophone=0 ExclusiveMode=1 LatencyBuffer=4 ForceDefaultPlaybackDevice= ForceWDM=0 ForceDirectXSink=0 DumpAudioLog=0 MaxOutputBufferSize=0 RealToneCableOnly=0 Win32UltraLowLatencyMode=1 [Renderer.Win32] ShowGamepadUI=0 ScreenWidth=1920 ScreenHeight=1080 Fullscreen=2 VisualQuality=1 RenderingWidth=0 RenderingHeight=0 EnablePostEffects=1 EnableShadows=1 EnableHighResScope=1 EnableDepthOfField=1 EnablePerPixelLighting=1 MsaaSamples=4 DisableBrowser 0f148eb4a0
