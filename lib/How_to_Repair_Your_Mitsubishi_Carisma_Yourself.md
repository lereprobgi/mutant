## Common Problems and Solutions for Mitsubishi Carisma
 
Mitsubishi Carisma is a reliable and durable car, but like any other vehicle, it may have some problems over time. Here are some of the most common ones and how to fix them:
 
- **Engine overheating**: This can be caused by a faulty thermostat, a clogged radiator, a leaking coolant hose, or a low coolant level. To fix this problem, you need to check the coolant level and top it up if necessary, replace the thermostat if it is stuck or broken, flush the radiator and refill it with fresh coolant, and inspect the hoses for any leaks or cracks.
- **Brake squeaking or grinding**: This can be caused by worn brake pads, rotors, or calipers, or by dirt or debris on the brake components. To fix this problem, you need to remove the wheels and inspect the brake pads, rotors, and calipers for any signs of wear or damage. If they are worn out or damaged, you need to replace them with new ones. You also need to clean the brake components with a brake cleaner spray and a wire brush to remove any dirt or debris.
- **Electrical issues**: This can be caused by a dead battery, a faulty alternator, a blown fuse, or a loose or corroded wire. To fix this problem, you need to check the battery voltage and charge it if it is low, replace the alternator if it is not generating enough power, check the fuses and replace any that are blown, and inspect the wires for any loose or corroded connections.
