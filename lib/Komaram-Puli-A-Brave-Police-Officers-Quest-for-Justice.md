Rahman's music and the action sequences, but criticized for its weak screenplay, excessive length and poor editing. The film was also a commercial failure at the box office.

Komaram Puli has several songs composed by A.R. Rahman, who collaborated with S.J. Suryah for the second time after New (2004). The songs are sung by various artists such as Vijay Prakash, Tanvi Shah, Shreya Ghoshal, Naresh Iyer and Madhushree. The lyrics are written by Chandrabose and N.M. Fazil. Some of the popular songs from the film are Power Star, Amma Thalle, Dochey and Namakame.
 
The film also has some impressive action scenes choreographed by Peter Hein and Stun Siva. Pawan Kalyan performed most of his stunts without a body double and showcased his martial arts skills. The film features a helicopter chase sequence, a car explosion scene and a climactic fight between Puli and Al Saleem.
 
Komaram Puli was made on a budget of â¹45 crore and was one of the most expensive Telugu films at that time. The film was shot in various locations such as Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangkok and New Zealand. The film faced several delays and controversies during its production and release. The film's title was changed from Komaram Puli to Puli due to some political issues, but later reverted to its original name. The film also faced plagiarism allegations from Hollywood films such as Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.
 
Komaram Puli was expected to be a blockbuster hit, but it failed to live up to the expectations of the fans and critics. The film opened to mixed reviews and poor word-of-mouth. The film also faced stiff competition from other Telugu releases such as Khaleja, Brindavanam and Robo. The film collected only â¹20 crore at the worldwide box office and was declared a disaster.
 
Komaram Puli is not a film for everyone. It is a film that tries to be a mass entertainer, but ends up being a mess. It is a film that has some good elements, but they are overshadowed by the bad ones. It is a film that could have been much better, but it is not.
